upgrade:
  - |
    Bump minimum version of puppetlabs-stdlib to 4.13.0 as we are using the
    any2bool function.
fixes:
  - |
    oslo.log fails if the debug setting is the configuration file is not a
    boolean. So we've added boolean conversion to the setting to ensure that
    we are either passing a proper boolean or $::os_service_default.  We are
    leveraging puppetlabs-stdlib any2bool for the conversion. LP#1719929
